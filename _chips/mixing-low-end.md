## Kick
{% assign link1 = site.chips | where: "slug", "sub-bass-range-edm" | first %}
1. Select your kick note in the key of your song. To get the most powerful sound, choose it from the chip [Best notes for sub bass range in EDM]({{ link1.url }}).
1. Adjust the length of the kick tail to between 25% and 50% of the bar.

## Reference Track
1. Pick a track that you think has the perfect low end.
1. Add it to your project and loop a section with just kick and bass.
1. Using a loudness meter, set the loudness of the the kick to -6dB.
1. Find out the relationship between the kick and the bass. Usually the bass is around -12 to -15dB.

## Mixing the kick and the bass.
{% assign link2 = site.chips | where: "slug", "pultec-eq" | first %}
{% assign link3 = site.chips | where: "slug", "mixing-distortion-saturation" | first %}
{% assign link4 = site.chips | where: "slug", "glue-compressor" | first %}
1. Set the loudness for your kick at -6dB.
1. Set the loudness of the bass at -15dB.
1. Add a sidechain compressor to the bass from the kick, as shown in the video.
1. Check if the bass level is still at -12-15dB.
1. Do the same for sub-bass and bass if they are separate tracks.
1. Use techniques like [Pultec EQ]({{ link2.url }}), [Glue Compressor]({{ link4.url }}), and [How to Use Distortion and Saturation in Mixing]({{ link3.url }}) to get even tighter low end.
