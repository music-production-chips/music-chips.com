### Adding punch to the low end
1-2dB of saturation can help the kick and the bass to cut through the mix.
Keep in mind that saturation acts as a compressor and will eat up the transients. Use parallel processing to get the best results.

### Enhancing the vocals
Depending on the timbre of the voice, you can either saturate the entire track or select specific frequencies to create higher harmonics.

### Mixing in the returns
Add some saturation to your spacial effects bus to help it blend into the mix.

### Parallel processing
Try applying saturation via the parallel chain for more control, e.g. to process a selected frequency range or to preserve the original transients.

### Which plugin to use?
There are many plug-ins that emulate specific devices (e.g. tape saturation) or do generic saturation, but it all comes down to soft/hard clipping, the range of harmonics produced, EQ/filter and speed of response (attack, release). I suggest you start with a plug-in you already have in your DAW, such as Overdrive in Logic Pro, and take it from there.
