- [ ] Check your mix again against the references. Turn down the volume of the reference tracks to match the volume of your mix.
- [ ] Check the loudness of your leads in different parts of the track. Your lead should be as loud in the intro as it is in the last chorus.
- [ ] The volume of the lead track should not be too close to or too far away from the rhythm and harmony tracks.
- [ ] Play your mix at a relatively high volume, no sounds or instruments should be unpleasant.
- [ ] Check the difference between peak and RMS. It should be in the 5-10dB range, unless it is intentional.
- [ ] Check the midrange for divergent tracks
- [ ] Your mix should have a little less high-end than your reference tracks, because mastering will add a little more.
- [ ] Check the LUFS vs RMS. If they are too far apart you may need to check the low-end.
- [ ] Check the crest-factor in the low-end.
- [ ] Give the mix one more listen for any technical issues.
