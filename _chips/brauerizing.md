name: Brauerizing
description: >
  The term "Brauerizing" refers to a mixing technique developed by Michael
  Brauer, a Grammy award-winning mixing engineer. It involves feeding audio
  into compressors and equalizers to add harmonics to the input signal and
  using group compression to blend audio together through a process called
  "counter pumping." It consists of three stages of "Brauerizing": Multi-Bus
  Compression, Multi-Vocal Compression, and the use of dual parallel
  1176 compressors for added depth in the mix.
